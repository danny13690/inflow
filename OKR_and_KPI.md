## OKRS 
Note: our goal for this course is to create a MVP version of the final product, so OKRs will reflect what constitutes a *minimal* viable product:
  * Allow brands to create campaign specs
    * E.g. the brand name, number of influencers needed, pay, KPI, etc.
    * Analogous to a job specification for new hire
  * Allow influencers to apply to/ indicate interest in brand campaigns
  * Functional log-in and authentication of Instagram
    * Look into Instagram direct log-in
  * Web scraping to report engage metrics
