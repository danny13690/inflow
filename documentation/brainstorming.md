# Brainstorming Ideas

## Idea 1: Duplicating photo remover

- Group setting
	- AI to choose the photo where everyone's eyes are open
	- Choose the best overall photo to send to everyone
	- Issue: people often want the best photo of themselves
- Individual setting
	- For photos in general, a widget to collapse your iPhone photo library
	- AI optional - you can choose your favorite one and have the others automatically collapsed

## Idea 2: AI generated custom travel itineraries

- Itinerary planning primarily considers geographic locations
	- You tell the app all the places you want to hit, and the app will automatically generate itineraries for you that make the most sense given your method of transportation
	- You can ask the system for recommendations to fill in empty spots, give certain days certain themes (e.g. nature), have certain inflexible events (e.g. Opera on Saturday night)
- Monetization
	- Recommendation opportunity for local stores, shops, and tourism businesses
	- Freemium model

## Idea 3: Friendzone

- Swipe based matching for friends
	- Auction mechanism: you don't create your own profile, but have one of your friends create it for you (inspired by Subtle Asian Dating phenomenon)
- Security features
	- Authentification with Instagram necessary
- Encourage interaction
	- Game pigeon-like gamification of chatting 
	- Limited number of matches per day to prevent backlog (or for program to maintain backlog for user)
